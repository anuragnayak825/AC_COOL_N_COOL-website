        <h3>Why is air con servicing is needed?</h3>
        <ul class="is-needed">
            <p>
                To save money: The filters, coils, and fins of a cooling system require regular maintenance, so that the
                appliance is able to function effectively and efficiently. Neglecting timely servicing and maintenance
                shall result in a steady decline in the performance of the unit, while its energy usage would keep
                rising. Greater energy consumption shall lead to higher electricity bills for you. Routine servicing of
                the system, can, however, help maintain up to 95 per cent of its original operational efficiency
                performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make your air con last longer: Seeking out Aircond Service Kl from any professional provider of such
                solutions, such as AC Cool N Cool Engineering can go a long way in improving the overall lifetime of
                your system. An HVAC system ideally must be between 10 to 15 years before requiring a replacement.
                However, this is only possible if the system has been regularly serviced by a professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                To breathe in cleaner air: If you use your cooling system over the season, there is a good chance that
                debris and dirt shall collect inside their filters. These particles can be released into the air inside
                your home, degrading the quality of air within the space. Our technicians would properly clean the coils
                and filters of your unit during the servicing process, so that you can breathe in healthier air.
