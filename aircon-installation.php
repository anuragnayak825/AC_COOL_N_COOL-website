        <h3 id="units">Common reasons why air con units may malfunction or breakdown</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Refrigerant Leak:</strong> If your system is running constantly, a joint can become loose,
                causing the
                refrigerant to leak. This may happen at random or due to a service valve.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Blown out breaker switch:</strong> If a circuit breaker has too much electric current, it would
                turn off for
                safety reasons. HVAC systems use a good amount of electricity, which may trigger the flip breaker to
                turn off.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Broken Compressor:</strong> The HVAC system won’t work if its compressor is not working.
                Usually, compressors
                stop working due to electrical failures, refrigerant issues, and overheating,
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dirty coils and/or fan blades: </strong> If the coils of the system are dirty, it may result in
                a huge lack of air
                flow and ultimately cause hot air to be blown out. Due to this, your system might overheat and break
                down.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dirty air filters:</strong> If the air vent filters are not cleaned then air won’t be able to
                pass through your
                HVAC system efficiently. Hence, it shall take a long time to cool your home. The longer is the cooling
                cycle, there would be greater risk of your system to freeze and completely stop working.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clogged drain line:</strong> Clogging in the drain line usually takes place due to
                over-accumulation of debris,
                mold, and even fungi. Such a situation can lead to excess in-water stock and spillage. AC Cool N Cool
                Engineering offers effective solutions for Aircon water leaking, and hence can solve this issue quite
                efficiently.
