                unit:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong> Poor Airflow:</strong> If you find that the airflow coming out of your vents has weakened
                    or ceased
                    altogether, then there might be a problem with the compressor of your system or its air ducts. Due
                    to these problems, air may not circulate properly to cool the room.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Warm Air:</strong> Finding warm air coming out from the vents of your system is an obvious
                    sign that you need
                    aircon repair assistant. This problem may arise if the compressor is not able to adequately cool the
                    air or if your system does not have enough refrigerant. Another possible cause could be a crack or
                    leak in the ductwork of the system that is allowing warm air to come in from the attic or crawl
                    space. It is important to seek out repair assistance as soon as you observe warm air coming out from
                    the system; otherwise, you shall be paying for its energy consumption without benefiting from it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Strange Odors:</strong> Any kind of unpleasant or unusual odor coming from the system is an
                    indication of a
                    problem. While strange odors can signify several issues, the most common one is damage caused to the
                    electrical wiring. This is a major hazard and hence you need to schedule an HVAC repair immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Odd sounds:</strong> Apart from the consistent hum your system might make while is running
                    and the sound of
                    flowing air running through your vents, the cooling unit should not make any noise. Clicking noises
                    coming from it can be a sign of obstructions in your fan. Squealing noises can indicate belt
                    problems, and metal screeching sounds can mean bad bearings.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Prompt repair services should be sought out for Aircon water leaking as well. Regardless of the problem,
                you might be facing, the team of AC Cool N Cool Engineering can effectively aid you to resolve it.

        <h3 id="units">Common reasons why air con units may malfunction or breakdown</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Refrigerant Leak:</strong> If your system is running constantly, a joint can become loose,
                causing the
                refrigerant to leak. This may happen at random or due to a service valve.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Blown out breaker switch:</strong> If a circuit breaker has too much electric current, it would
                turn off for
                safety reasons. HVAC systems use a good amount of electricity, which may trigger the flip breaker to
                turn off.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Broken Compressor:</strong> The HVAC system won’t work if its compressor is not working.
                Usually, compressors
                stop working due to electrical failures, refrigerant issues, and overheating,
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dirty coils and/or fan blades: </strong> If the coils of the system are dirty, it may result in
                a huge lack of air
                flow and ultimately cause hot air to be blown out. Due to this, your system might overheat and break
                down.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dirty air filters:</strong> If the air vent filters are not cleaned then air won’t be able to
                pass through your
                HVAC system efficiently. Hence, it shall take a long time to cool your home. The longer is the cooling
                cycle, there would be greater risk of your system to freeze and completely stop working.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clogged drain line:</strong> Clogging in the drain line usually takes place due to
                over-accumulation of debris,
                mold, and even fungi. Such a situation can lead to excess in-water stock and spillage. AC Cool N Cool
                Engineering offers effective solutions for Aircon water leaking, and hence can solve this issue quite
                efficiently.
